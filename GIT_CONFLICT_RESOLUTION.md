# Git Push Conflict Resolution

The error you're seeing means the GitHub repository already has some content that conflicts with your local repository. Here are the solutions:

## Option 1: Pull Remote Changes First (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Pull and merge remote changes
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Push your combined changes
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Force Push (OVERWRITES REMOTE)
```bash
# WARNING: This will overwrite everything on GitHub
git push origin main --force
```

## Option 3: Start Fresh with New Repository Name
```bash
# Remove current remote
git remote remove origin

# Create a new repository with different name on GitHub
# Then add the new remote:
git remote add origin https://github.com/unnatii14/fish-classifier-backend-v2.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Run These Commands Now:

### Solution 1 (Recommended):
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Hetvi\Downloads\fish-classifier-backend-main (3)\fish-classifier-backend-main"
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

If you get merge conflicts, look for files with `<<<<<<<` markers and resolve them, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### Solution 2 (If you want to overwrite GitHub):
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Hetvi\Downloads\fish-classifier-backend-main (3)\fish-classifier-backend-main"
git push origin main --force
```

Try Solution 1 first!
