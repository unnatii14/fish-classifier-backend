# Railway Deployment Fix - Action Plan

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue Analysis
Your Railway deployment shows "Not Found" which indicates the service isn't running properly.

## âœ… Immediate Solutions

### 1. **Simplify Railway Configuration**
The current deployment might be failing due to complex model loading. Let's create a minimal working version first.

### 2. **Alternative Railway Deployment Method**
Instead of CLI deployment, use Railway's GitHub integration:

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create new project 
3. Connect GitHub repository: `fish-classifier-backend`
4. Railway will auto-deploy from GitHub

### 3. **Verify Local API First**
Test locally to ensure everything works before Railway deployment.

### 4. **Railway Environment Variables**
May need to set specific environment variables for Railway.

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps
1. Fix local API startup
2. Create minimal Railway-ready version
3. Use Railway GitHub integration
4. Test and verify deployment

## ðŸ“± For Flutter App
Once working, use: https://lively-amazement-production-e614.up.railway.app

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- âœ… API responds to health checks
- âœ… Fish classification endpoints work
- âœ… Similar fish search works
- âœ… All model files loaded correctly
